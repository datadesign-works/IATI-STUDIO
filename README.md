#### IATI Studio
--------

IATI Studio is a webbased platform enabling you to publish IATI, build smart data interfaces and websites. It comes with a large collection of components like transparency portals, charts, maps, data tables, forms, a free API and much more. No coding involved!

A revolutionary data platform enabling development aid workers and data consumers use to manage [IATI data](http://iatiregistry.org/). With IATI Studio anyone can publish open data in IATI and create beautiful webinterfaces with that data. Non IATI publishers are also able to extract IATI data from any publisher on the [IATI registry](http://iatiregistry.org/) and create real-time visualisation based on their filter selection.

Built on [OIPA, the opensource data-engine for IATI data](https://github.com/zimmerman-zimmerman/OIPA), IATI Studio provides the next generation free IATI open platform for data hungry publishers and consumers. As a future or current IATI publisher you can start managing your data directly from the IATI registry or start publishing your first IATI data from the Studio.

IATI is a global aid transparency standard and it makes information about aid spending easier to access, re-use and understand the underlying data using a unified open standard. You can find more about the IATA XML standard at: www.iatistandard.org
